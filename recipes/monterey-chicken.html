        <li>1 cup teriyaki marinade sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 pound bacon</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To Marinate: Place chicken in a nonporous glass dish or bowl. Pour marinade over chicken and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate to marinate for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and place in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Reserve 1/3 cup marinade and discard the rest.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until cooked through and juices run clear.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In same skillet, melt butter over medium high heat. Saute onion, bell pepper and mushrooms for about 3 to 5 minutes. Add reserved 1/3 cup of marinade and simmer until soft. Drain and set onion mixture aside.</li>
        <li>Top baked chicken with bacon strips. Add onion mixture and top each breast with a slice of cheese. Bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
